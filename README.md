# Tic_Tac_Toe
 Tic Tac Toe game using python

This tic-tac-toe game utilizes several functions to emulate the real game. First, X will always go first, and O will follow - until a winner is declared. Players are not allowed to overwrite another player's position - otherwise, they will be met with an error and asked to try again. 

Enjoy.
